            <div>
             <p>I am a Cyber Security Analyst and Project Manager with experience in a wide range of tools and software and have a 
            passion for continued learning and development. I thrive with stakeholder engagement and bridging the gap between techincal 
            users and developers to every day users. It's important to remember that staying organized will always help in finding 
            clarity in the chaos.

              When I am not working or pursuing further Cyber Security Certifications, you can find me in the mountains. 
              During the warmer months, I love getting out for trail runs, on my bike along gravel roads, backpacking, 
              and spending time with my dog and two rabbits! During the winter months, I enjoy benefiting from the *superior* 
              EPIC ski pass, nordic skiing, or catching up on the ever growing book list.
